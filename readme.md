# CPS Monitoring using MDD
This repository contains multiple projects for a Model-Driven Development (MDD) pipeline to address the development of (mobile) Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and appropriate monitoring applications for them.

In the `src` folder all the projects included in this pipeline can be found, as well as some additional utiltity projects like an annotation processor or driver functions for a Roomba vacum cleaner robot.

Additionally, the `examples` folder contains the **Indoor Transport System** showcase project, that was developed using the tools of the pipeline.
